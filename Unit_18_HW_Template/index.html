        <h1>Anthony Rodriguez</h1>
        <p>Hello! I am, Anthony Rodriguez. 
          I’m a passionate UI/UX designer who thrives on using
          creativity to craft intuitive and visually engaging digital
          experiences. My work involves blending artistic vision
          with user-centered design principles to transform
          complex challenges into simple, elegant solutions.
          With a strong focus on creating user-friendly and
          aesthetically pleasing interfaces, I use my
          problem-solving skills to deliver designs that are not
          only user-friendly but also visually pleasing.
          When I’m not immersed in design, you’ll often find me
          exploring new places. Traveling fuels my creativity and
          broadens my perspective, reinforcing my belief that
          continuous learning is critical for success. The
          ever-evolving world of design offers endless
          opportunities for growth, and I’m always motivated to
          refine my skills and embrace new trends.</p>

        <h3>User Research</h3>
        <img src="/images/UX RESEARCHER SKILLS.png">
        <p>For user research, I typically will conduct interviews, create a
          user persona, and create
          empathy maps to fully
          understand where the business
          currently stands. This aids me in
          the ability to fully comprehend
          what we need to do in order to
          design according to the needs of
          the company and the user.</p>

        <h3>Wireframing</h3>
        <img src="/images/WIREFRAMING.png">
        <p>When it comes to wireframing, it
          is easier for me to put my
          thoughts down on paper. This
          allows me to place content
          where the research initially led
          me. From here I am able to see if
          there was something missed or if
          something needs to be redefined.
          It helps communicate the
          ideas as we begin to develop the
          work.</p>

        <h3>High Fidelity Prototyping</h3>
        <img src="/images/HIGH FIDELITY PROTOTYPES.png">
        <p>LPrototyping has become one of
          my joys. Because here, I am able
          to see my designs come to life.
          Understand what works and
          doesn’t work. Conduct user tests
          to further determine whether
          the design works or doesn’t. It
          also helps me see what
          improvements we are able to
          make.</p>
